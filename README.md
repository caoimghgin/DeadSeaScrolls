DeadSeaScrolls
==============

There are many incomplete and/or outdated solutions on the internet for creating a UIScrollView programmatically on iOS with AutoLayout. This is an example I cobbled together from several sources, adding UIView+AutoLayout via CocoaPods (you'll want to add this CocoaPod yourself to make this sample work).

To me, this process is non-intuitive at best. It's helpful to preserve the simplest possible implimentation of this feature for use in future projects.
