DeadSeaScrolls
==============

There are many of incomplete and/or outdated solutions on the internet for creating a UIScrollView programmatically on iOS with AutoLayout. This is an example I cobbled together from several sources, adding UIView+AutoLayout via CocoaPods (you'll want to add this CocoaPod yourself to make this sample work).

This process is very non-intuitive and it's helpful to preserve the simplest possible implimentation for use in future projects.
